I'm designing the levels in Blender. All of the levels are oriented as they are related within the world, but disconnected into separate spaces.

For example, the start apartment and the floor hallway which connects to the lobby and then the outside are arranged so that the doors & elevators are aligned, but without the implied space between them, or with additional space and duplicate doors (inside and outside).

The 3d model serves as both a guide for building the game level files and a way to experiment with models that will be rendered into in-game sprites, and to storyboard.

Individual pieces will be rendered into 2d sprites for the game and assembled into level files.
