Moving NPCs

  * Switch from one behavior to another based on world conditions/input

    - Example: game notifies characters when the player is close to them / the npc is on screen.

  * A waypoint behavior will follow a path set by a series of points, and optionally
    return to the original point and cycle through the path indefintely.

    - NPCs may go at a slower or faster pace during each leg of the path,
      and wait a set amount of time at each waypoint.

    - Initiallly use very specific paths, so no pathfinding code is needed.

  * NPCs use pathfinding code to move

-----------

* Level files and/or spritesheet files support key frame animations

* Level settings can optionally have player inventory, health, etc
