Moving NPCs

  * Switch from one behavior to another based on world conditions/input

    - Example: game notifies characters when the player is close to them / the npc is on screen.

    - Finite state machine
    
    - Table from level file

      ['initialState',
       {'initialState': {'input_token': 'nextState',
                         'input2': 'nextState2',
                         ...
                        },
        ...
       },
       {'initialState': {inTransition: ['method', 'param'], outTransition: ['method', 'param']},
        ...}
      ]
    
    - Inputs to FSM generated by NPCharacter update method

    - state transition triggers call methods on the NPCharacter


  * A waypoint behavior will follow a path set by a series of points, and optionally
    return to the original point and cycle through the path indefintely.

    - NPCs may go at a slower or faster pace during each leg of the path,
      and wait a set amount of time at each waypoint.

    - Initiallly use very specific paths, so no pathfinding code is needed.

  * NPCs use pathfinding code to move
