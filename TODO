Moving NPCs

  * NPCs use pathfinding code to move

  * Switch from one behavior to another based on world conditions/input

    - Finite state machine
    
    - Table from level file

      {'state': {'input': 'nextState', 'input2': 'nextState2'}, ...}
    
    - Inputs to FSM generated by NPCharacter update method

    - State representes the currently desired behavior

  * A waypoint behavior will follow a path set by a series of points, and optionally
    return to the original point and cycle through the path indefintely.

    - NPCs may go at a slower or faster pace during each leg of the path,
      and wait a set amount of time at each waypoint.
