Moving NPCs

  - A pacing NPC will move left and right over a set distance, unless they
    collide with an object, after which they will turn the other way and
    repeat in the opposite direction.

  - A waypoint NPC will follow a path set by a series of points, and optionally
    return to the original point and cycle through the path indefintely.

    - NPCs may go at a slower or faster pace during each leg of the path,
      and wait a set amount of time at each waypoint.
